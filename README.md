Spring's `TestContext` Context Caching is one of the **most** **unknown hidden gems of testing with Spring Boot** - it can cut your build times in half, and often even more.

Yet most developers aren't aware of it, and once they discover it, they need a tool to tell them how to optimize their test suite. That's where the Spring Test Profiler comes in.

The Spring Test Profiler is a Spring Test utility that provides visualization and insights for Spring Test execution, with a focus on Spring context caching. It helps you identify optimization opportunities in your Spring Test suite to speed up your builds and ship to production faster and with more confidence.

Fast build times = fast feedback and accelerated feature delivery!

## How Context Caching Works

Spring caches ApplicationContexts across tests: it X-rays each test's configuration, merges all customization points into a `MergedContextConfiguration`, and uses its hashCode as the cache key.

Same key means instant reuse - one tiny difference means a slow, brand-new context. The report's theory section shows this as an animation:

![Animation explaining Spring test context caching: Spring scans the test configuration, builds a cache key from the MergedContextConfiguration hashCode, and reuses matching ApplicationContexts](docs/context-caching-animation.gif)


## Features

**Overall goal**: Identify optimization opportunities in your Spring Test suite to speed up your builds and ship to production faster and with more confidence 🚤

This profiler helps you:

- Track Spring Test context caching statistics for your test suite
- Show context reuse metrics and cache hit/miss ratios
- Identify tests that couldn't reuse contexts and explain why
- Drastically reduce the build time of your project

## Requirements

[![Build & Test Maven Project (main)](https://github.com/PragmaTech-GmbH/spring-test-profiler/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PragmaTech-GmbH/spring-test-profiler/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

This profiler works with Java 17+ and is compatible with:

- Spring Framework 5 (Spring Boot 2)
- Spring Framework 6 (Spring Boot 3)
- Spring Framework 7 (Spring Boot 4)

## Prototype Phase

> [!WARNING]
> This project is highly work-in-progress and should be considered a prototype to gather feedback and ideas for future development.

What's currently not working or missing:

- Support for parallel test execution
- Fully-fledged visualization of the contexts on a timeline
- For each Gradle test task, a separate HTML report is generated
- For Surefire and Failsafe, a separate HTML report is generated

## Usage

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Latest%20Version-0.3.1-orange)](/spring-test-profiler-extension/pom.xml)

### 1. Add the Dependency

#### Quick Start Maven

Add the dependency to your project:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>digital.pragmatech.testing</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-test-profiler</artifactId>
  <version>0.3.1</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

#### Quick Start Gradle

Add the dependency to your project:

```groovy
testRuntimeOnly("digital.pragmatech.testing:spring-test-profiler:0.3.1")
```


### 2. Activate the Profiler

Pick **either one** of the following methods to activate the profiler in your tests.

#### Automatically for all Your Tests (Recommended)

Add a file named `META-INF/spring.factories` to your resources directory with the following content:

```text
org.springframework.test.context.TestExecutionListener=\
digital.pragmatech.testing.SpringTestProfilerListener
org.springframework.context.ApplicationContextInitializer=\
digital.pragmatech.testing.diagnostic.ContextDiagnosticApplicationInitializer
```

#### Manually for Specific Tests

Add the `@TestExecutionListeners` and `@ContextConfiguration` annotations to your test classes:

```java
@TestExecutionListeners(
  value = {SpringTestProfilerListener.class},
  mergeMode = TestExecutionListeners.MergeMode.MERGE_WITH_DEFAULTS
)
@ContextConfiguration(initializers = ContextDiagnosticApplicationInitializer.class)
```

This needs to be done for each test class where you want to use the profiler. Preferably, use this on a central abstract integration test class or use the automatic activation method above.

### 3. Run Your Tests

Execute your tests:

```bash
# Maven
./mvnw verify

# Gradle
./gradlew build
```

### 4. Analyze the Generated Report

After test execution, find the HTML report at:

- Maven: `target/spring-test-profiler/latest.html`
- Gradle: `build/spring-test-profiler/latest.html`

Next to the HTML report, a flat JSON summary is written for machine consumption (CI checks,
dashboards, trend tracking):

- Maven: `target/spring-test-profiler/results.json` (latest run) plus a timestamped
  `test-profiler-report-<timestamp>.json` per run
- Gradle: `build/spring-test-profiler/results.json` plus the timestamped file per run

The JSON contains a single flat object with metrics like `contextsCreated`, `totalDurationMs`,
`contextCacheHitRatio`, and `totalContextCreationTimeMs`, so it can be consumed with simple
tooling:

```bash
jq '.contextsCreated' target/spring-test-profiler/results.json
```

#### Guard Your Context Count in CI

Once you have optimized your test suite, you can pin the expected number of created contexts and
fail the build when it regresses (for example when someone introduces a new `@DirtiesContext` or
an accidental context configuration difference). Run this after your test suite, e.g. as a CI
step:

```bash
expectedContexts=3
actualContexts=$(jq -r '.contextsCreated' target/spring-test-profiler/results.json)

if [ "$actualContexts" != "$expectedContexts" ]; then
  echo "Expected $expectedContexts Spring contexts but $actualContexts were created"
  exit 1
fi
```

Other metrics work the same way, for example alerting when context creation time exceeds a budget:

```bash
totalContextCreationTimeMs=$(jq -r '.totalContextCreationTimeMs' target/spring-test-profiler/results.json)

if [ "$totalContextCreationTimeMs" -gt 60000 ]; then
  echo "Context creation took ${totalContextCreationTimeMs}ms, exceeding the 60s budget"
  exit 1
fi
```

This repository uses the same approach for its demo projects: each demo pins its expected context
count in a `context-info.json` file, and the CI pipeline verifies the generated `results.json`
against it with [`.github/scripts/verify-profiler-json.sh`](.github/scripts/verify-profiler-json.sh).

### 5. Add Custom Context Customizer Descriptions

Spring Test Profiler can show richer context customizer details when your project exposes a
`ContextCustomizerExtension` bean. This is useful when a customizer class is the same across test
contexts, but its internal configuration is different. A common example is a WireMock
`WireMockContextCustomizer`: two tests can both use the same customizer class, while each test
configures different mock names, ports, files, or properties.

Create a Spring bean in your test application context, for example with `@Component` or a test
`@Bean` method:

```java
package com.example.testing;

import digital.pragmatech.testing.extensions.ContextCustomizerExtension;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
class ExampleContextCustomizerExtension implements ContextCustomizerExtension {

  @Override
  public boolean supports(Object contextCustomizer) {
    // Return true only for the customizer type this extension knows how to describe.
    return contextCustomizer.getClass().getName().contains("ExampleContextCustomizer");
  }

  @Override
  public String describe(Object contextCustomizer) {
    // Return a stable, human-readable summary of the fields that make contexts differ.
    return contextCustomizer.getClass().getSimpleName() + "[configuration=custom]";
  }
}
```

The `supports(...)` method should be narrow: check the exact customizer class or a known interface.
The `describe(...)` method should include only deterministic configuration values that help explain why Spring created
a separate context. Avoid identity hashes, timestamps, random ports, or other values that change between runs unless
they are the actual configuration you want to compare.

If no extension supports a customizer, the report falls back to the customizer class simple name.
